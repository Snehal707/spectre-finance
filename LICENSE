ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMER FOR DEFI AND EXPERIMENTAL CRYPTOGRAPHY:

This software implements Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) through the Fhenix
CoFHE coprocessor. Users acknowledge and accept the following:

1. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGY: FHE is cutting-edge cryptography that may contain
   undiscovered vulnerabilities.

2. NO AUDIT: The smart contracts in this repository have NOT been audited by
   any third-party security firm.

3. TRUSTED COMPONENTS: The CoFHE coprocessor requires trust in threshold
   decryption operators. A compromised majority could decrypt user balances.

4. FUND RISK: Bugs in async decryption, contract logic, or the CoFHE
   infrastructure could result in permanent loss of funds.

5. TESTNET ONLY: This software is intended for testnet use. Using it with
   real assets on mainnet is at your own risk.

6. METADATA LEAKAGE: While balances and transfer amounts are encrypted,
   transaction timing, addresses, and deposit/withdrawal amounts remain
   visible on-chain.

BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD
THESE RISKS AND AGREE TO ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSSES.
