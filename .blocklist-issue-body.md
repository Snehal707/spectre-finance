- **Network:** Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- **Etherscan:** https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x9480557892B7e67347b105459C4b8F6B1F791A65

### 3. Project Details
Spectre Finance is a privacy-preserving DeFi protocol that allows users to:
- Deposit ETH and receive encrypted seETH balance
- Transfer funds privately using FHE encryption
- Withdraw securely through CoFHE coprocessor decryption

### 4. Technical Documentation
- Complete README with architecture diagrams
- Deployment documentation
- Security disclosures (SECURITY.md)
- Active development with proper CI/CD workflows

### 5. Active Transaction History
The contract shows legitimate usage patterns:
- Mint/Burn operations
- Encrypted transfers
- Proper integration with Fhenix CoFHE infrastructure

## Why This is a False Positive

I believe this domain was flagged due to:
1. **Vercel subdomain** - `.vercel.app` domains are commonly abused, but this is a legitimate testnet deployment
2. **Recent deployment** - The project is new but fully documented and open source
3. **Privacy focus** - While scammers abuse "privacy" messaging, this uses actual FHE technology from Fhenix Protocol

## Request

Please remove `spectre-finance.vercel.app` from the blocklist. This is a legitimate educational/testnet project demonstrating fully homomorphic encryption in DeFi.

I'm happy to provide any additional verification needed.

Thank you!
